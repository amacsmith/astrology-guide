# Transits and Progressions

In astrology, transits refer to the ongoing movement of the planets through the sky and how they interact with the positions of the planets in your natal chart. This interaction influences various life events, personal growth, and emotional experiences. For example, when a planet transits over a sensitive point in your chart, it can trigger significant changes or challenges in that area of your life. Understanding transits can help you prepare for upcoming experiences and make informed decisions.

## Key Transits

2. **Venus Retrograde**: This transit invites reflection on relationships, love, and values. It typically occurs every 18 months and can lead to misunderstandings or reevaluation of personal connections.

3. **Mercury Retrograde**: Known for communication disruptions and technical glitches, this transit happens three to four times a year. It is a time to review, revise, and reconnect rather than start new projects.
